also, Omar fit hijackers' profile: young, from well-to-do background, computer-literate with taste for liquor and nightclubs, just like Atta; Omar, who had applied for green card, passed polygraph test but still he was held and questioned repeatedly; no one knew where or when Al Qaeda would strike next, and FBI, Immigration and Naturalization Service and other government agencies were under fire for what was seen as their failure to detect Sept 11 attacks; Omar grew despondent in jail, went on hunger strike and threatened to commit suicide; authorities will not say why they finally decided that he must be telling truth, but his breakdown may have convinced them; most important indication of his innocence may be that for 73 days government could find nothing beyond its original suspicions to hold him on; many Americans believe necessity of preventing future terrorist attacks supersedes rights of any individual; ultimately, issue will be for Supreme Court and historians to decide; Omar is among at least 1,147 Muslim men who were initially rounded up in aftermath of Sept 11; of these, only 3 have resulted in terrorism-related indictments;
