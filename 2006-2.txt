These divergent opinions undoubtedly reflect the subjectivity of any one person\'s experience of a restaurant --- or for that matter, a book or movie. They may also reflect how much what happens inside a restaurant, unlike what happens in a book or movie, can change from night to night, even from hour to hour. One diner may go to a restaurant once and hit it on its best night or happen to order the very best dishes. Another diner may hit the restaurant on its worst night or stumble across an unrepresentative batch of clunkers. I go to restaurants multiple times so I can work my way through the majority of the menu and average out a restaurant\'s performances over time. But I should probably point out that not all star ratings are created equal, a fact perhaps obvious to some readers but not to others. For example some restaurants barely cross the barrier between one and two stars, while others fall just slightly short of the barrier between two and three stars. All of these restaurants end up with the same two-star rating, even though my degrees of enthusiasm for them may not be precisely the same. The star rating is a judgment call I make carefully. One more or one less star can affect business, but I have to give readers my honest opinion. I also hope that the full reviews of these restaurants, as opposed to a necessarily reductive star rating, gives readers a more complete sense of my thoughts and a better idea of whether its a restaurant that they would enjoy.')('2006022', 'Fortune has been doing a lot of "on one hand-on the other hand" in covering the real estate boom.
