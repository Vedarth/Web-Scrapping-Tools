says as animals figure less in everyday lives, pets notwithstanding, disconnect between, for example, meat and animals grows; reviews, and rejects, several arguments in Singer's book, drawing conclusions that differences between people and animals are sufficient to exclude them from moral consideration afforded to people; says suffering of humans is more difficult to justify because emotions such as dread combined with unique quality of human consciousness carry weight in calculus; argues that human pain differs from animal pain by order of magnitude and ability to imagine alternatives; describes conditions on factory farms where he contends animals are treated as machines incapable of feeling pain and subjected to hellish conditions; also describes conditions on farm where animals are treated humanely; says animal happiness appears to derive from their being able to express unique character and believes animal rights activists betray ignorance of workings of nature on this point; says no other country has industrialized and dehumanized animal farming as America has and believes if people were aware of horrors, they would eat less meat;
