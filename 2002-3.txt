extensive and highly unusual ties to medical supply companies have raised question over whether their mission to use market power of more than 1,500 hospitals to find best medical products at lowest prices, is being compromised; problem stems from fact that groups are financed not by hospitals that buy products, but by companies that sell them and make money from very companies they are supposed to evaluate objectively; each year, companies pay Premier and Novation hundreds of millions of dollars in fees that represent percentage of hospital purchases; more hospitals spend on medical supplies, more money both companies get from suppliers; Premier and some of its officials have also received stocks or options from companies which Premier contracts; small manufacturers complain of competitive disadvantage; say they have been effectively blocked by groups, which have secured exclusive contracts with hospitals and largely determine which products many hospitals buy; critics say such conflicts of interest can mean that buying groups do not always choose products that are best for patients, hospitals or taxpayers or insurance that pays their bills;
