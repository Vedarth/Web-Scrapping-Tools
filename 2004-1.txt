Rep Richard A Gephardt finishes fourth, ending his second bid for presidency; Kerry comes from behind to win by presenting himself as strongest Democrat his party has to send up against Pres Bush next year; result is serious setback for Dean, who has campaigned intensely across state for more than year; he promises to battle on; survey of caucus voters suggests that Dean's central appeal--opposition to war in Iraq--did him little good; Edwards seems delighted if bit surprised by outcome; says voters responded to his relentlessly cheerful message, drawing unstated but obvious contrast with Dean; with 98 percent of precincts reporting, Kerry has nearly 38 percent of delegate support, Edwards gets 32 percent, Dean takes 18 percent and Gephardt picks up 10 percent; Rep Dennis J Kucinich gets 1 percent; Dean's showing raises questions about intriguing element of his candidacy: that he recruited thousands of first-time voters who could transform nature of American presidential politics; although half the voters were attending their first Iowa caucuses, 36 percent voted for Kerry, 22 percent for Dean and 24 percent for Edwards; photo; chart (L)")('2004012', "Anna Bahney The Neediest Cases column discusses Vanya Keenan's struggle to care for son while getting treatment for kidney disease;
